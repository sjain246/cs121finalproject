TODO: High-level program overview
******************************************************************************
This is a template you may start with for your Final Project application.
You may choose to modify it, or you may start with the example function
stubs (most of which are incomplete).
Some sections are provided as recommended program breakdowns, but are optional
to keep, and you will probably want to extend them based on your application's
features.
TODO:
- Make a copy of app-template.py to a more appropriately named file. You can
  either use app.py or separate a client vs. admin interface with app_client.py,
  app_admin.py (you can factor out shared code in a third file, which is
  recommended based on submissions in 22wi).
- For full credit, remove any irrelevant comments, which are included in the
  template to help you get started. Replace this program overview with a
  brief overview of your application as well (including your name/partners name).
  This includes replacing everything in this *** section!
